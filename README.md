# Calendar01

## OVERVIEW

Standard React Native educational project. One screens: with calendar by month and by daily tasts.

## OBJECTIVE

This is the third project to extend my React Native Development, delievered very quickly (2h). Simply explored the power of open-source 
React Native modules. This is a quick install ready-made Calendar module provided by the guys at Wix. Here is the module https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-calendars

## SOME IMPROVEMENTS

- add a "done" & "delete" icon to the each task
- clicking done - the task changes color and goes at the end of the list
- clicking delete - the task is deleted from the list

## LEARNING CURVE

- Combersome to init the environment. I will probably create a Docker image, to reduce setup times.
- Even though installing the module was very quick and easy, props and uses were difficult to understand. 
- The documentation is unfortuntalely very limited and the examples provided presented bugs. 
- Overall it was great to see how powerful these open-source projects can be. 
- The calendar module is great to keep in mind for future app projects that will require it. Like: booking sys or events & appointments app.
